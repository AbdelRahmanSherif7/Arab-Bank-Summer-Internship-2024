During my Digital Transformation Internship at Arab Bank, I worked on enhancing personalized financial advisory services through AI-driven solutions. I developed an AI-powered financial advisor concept, leveraging decision tree algorithms to provide customers with real-time banking recommendations based on their financial behavior. Additionally, I conducted User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and test case design for the mobile banking application, ensuring optimal performance, usability, and compliance with digital banking standards. My role involved analyzing e-payment workflows, refining algorithmic efficiency, and ensuring smooth customer interactions within the banking ecosystem.
